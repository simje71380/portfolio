                                        We completed this project during my virtual worlds studies at UTBM.
                                         The objective was to develop a Virtual Reality video game where players could design their own smart city.
                                          We successfully created a VR game reminiscent of SimCity,
                                           with a primary focus on the ecological and sustainable aspects of city planning.

                                        During an image synthesis course at the UTBM, I completed a project to create a 3D model of a dining room using Blender.
                                         This project was an open-ended exercise, allowing people to demonstrate their creative and technical skills in 3D modeling
                                          without specific constraints.

                                        During my second year at UTBM, I completed a 6-month internship as an assistant engineer at <a href="https://www.cmseddyscan.com/en/non-destructive-testing/" target="_blank">CMS</a>. 
                                        In this role, I was tasked with developing a new ultrasonic device control application in 64-bit JAVA.

                                    <span class="jump">
                                        To accomplish this, my initial responsibilities involved migrating various 32-bit drivers to the 64-bit environment.
                                         I also had to port the legacy C-based application, originally developed with LabWindows CVI,
                                          to the 64-bit platform. During this porting process, I encountered a challenge related to a DLL provided exclusively in 32-bit by the manufacturer.
                                           To resolve this, I created a 64-bit wrapper for the 32-bit DLL using WoW64 and an ATL server for Inter Process Communication.

                                    <span class="jump">
                                        Finally, I developed the new application in JAVA, leveraging JavaFX and Scene Builder.
                                         To interface with the PCI cards, I utilized JNI to work with the pre-existing DLLs, which I recompiled into 64-bit versions.

                                         My primary task was to develop an application allowing the asynchronous copying of files generated by the
                                          supervisory application while reporting any errors back to the supervisory system.

                                        I had the option to develop this application in either C/C++ or VB.Net. However, as my mentor was proficient only in VB.Net,
                                         I opted for this programming language.

                                        Due to my efficiency in completing the initial task ahead of schedule, I had the opportunity to enhance the supervisory

                                         For example the integration of barcode reading, replacing manual data entry.
